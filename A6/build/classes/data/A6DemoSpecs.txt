DO THESE IN THIS ORDER
   - delete Log file
   - run UserApp program
   - print Log file
   - print your code files

PACKET TO HAND IN - IN THIS ORDER
   - cover page
   - Log file printout (smaller font [NOT TOO SMALL, WHICH WOULD IRRITATE GRADER]
			& landscape orientation & smaller margins
         		to save paper)
   - UserApp program file
   - MapData class file
   - ShortestRoute class file
   - any other code files

Make sure you:

- follow the EXACT format specs for the log file in my specs
- follow MY way of storing the Graph data (using "infinity"'s,
    zeros, good edgeWeights)
- use the version of Dijkstra's Algorithm that I discussed in class
- include the IMPORTANT MODIFICATION that I described in the specs
    regarding CHOOSING TARGETS only in the correct peninsula!!!!
- use the method names from the specs
- have the right answers:
	- check if they seem reasonable,
	- make sure there aren't duplicates in path or trace,
	- make sure trace's order of cities "follows what you
		know D's Algor should do"
	- compare your results with someone else's
- program prints TraceOfTargets
	- in the ORDER THAT THEY ARE SELECTED
		(NOT AFTER the search is over and you just dump
		 	the included nodes - that would give WRONG RESULTS)
	- includes START city (even though it's technically
		not selected as a target inside the loop
- the answer path prints:
    - from start to destination (not destination to start)
    - using city NAMES not city NUMBERS
